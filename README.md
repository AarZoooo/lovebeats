## Introduction

The global online dating market is estimated to be worth $9.65 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow to $10.49 billion in 2023. The market is dominated by a few major players, such as Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge. However, there is still room for new entrants, especially those that target niche audiences.

This project proposes to develop a dating app that matches users based on their shared love of music. The app will use the official SDKs from Spotify, Apple Music, and other music streaming services to access users' listening history and playlists. This data will be used to develop a matching algorithm that will recommend users who are likely to have a connection.

The app will also have a number of other features, such as the ability to create and share music playlists, find concerts and events, and chat with other users.

## Market Analysis

The market for dating apps is highly competitive. The major players in the market include Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge. These apps have a large user base and a wide range of features.

However, there is still room for new entrants, especially those that target niche audiences. The proposed app will target users who are passionate about music. This is a large and growing audience, and there is no other app that matches users based on their shared love of music.

## Scope of the Application

The proposed app will have the following features:

- Matching users based on their shared love of music
- Ability to chat with other users
- Ability to share music playlists
- Ability to put date reminders

The app will be available on both Android and iOS platforms.

## Frontend Development

The frontend of the app will be developed using Kotlin and Android Studio. Kotlin is a modern programming language that is concise and expressive. It is also fully interoperable with Java, so you can use existing Java code in your Kotlin app.

Android Studio is the official IDE for developing Android apps. It is a powerful and feature-rich IDE that makes it easy to develop and debug Android apps.

## Backend Development

The backend of the app will be developed using Firebase. Firebase is a BaaS platform that provides a wide range of features and services, including authentication, real-time data synchronization, and push notifications. It also has a free tier that is sufficient for most small and medium-sized apps.

We will use Firebase to store user data, such as their name, email address, and music preferences. We will also use Firebase to send push notifications to users when they have new matches.

We will not be using Heroku or DigitalOcean for the backend of our app. We believe that Firebase is a more comprehensive and cost-effective solution for our needs.

## Testing and Deployment

The app will be tested using a variety of methods, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.

The app will be deployed to the App Store and Google Play.

## Marketing and Promotion

The app will be marketed and promoted through a variety of channels, including social media, online advertising, and public relations.

## Conclusion

This project proposes to develop a dating app that matches users based on their shared love of music. The app will use the official SDKs from Spotify, Apple Music, and other music streaming services to access users' listening history and playlists. This data will be used to develop a matching algorithm that will recommend users who are likely to have a connection.

The app will also have a number of other features, such as the ability to create and share music playlists, find concerts and events, and chat with other users.

The app will be available on both Android and iOS platforms.

The project faces a number of challenges, including the high competition in the dating app market and the need to raise funding. However, the team is confident that the app has the potential to be successful.
