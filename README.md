## Introduction

The global online dating market is estimated to be worth $9.65 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow to $10.49 billion in 2023. The market is dominated by a few major players, such as Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge. However, there is still room for new entrants, especially those that target niche audiences.

This project proposes to develop a dating app that matches users based on their shared love of music. The app will use the official SDKs from Spotify, Apple Music, and other music streaming services to access users' listening history and playlists. This data will be used to develop a matching algorithm that will recommend users who are likely to have a connection.

The app will also have a number of other features, such as the ability to create and share music playlists, find concerts and events, and chat with other users.
